    # NOTE: Two data directories were transferred to the wilsontelab_globus_from_agc endpoint for this request. 
    #       The first sequencing run of this request yielded fewer reads than expected (3333-SA directory). 
    #       We sequenced this request on a second run to reach the desired number of reads (3333-SA_resequence).
